In here, there are only folders and model files.

## All of the folders follow the following pattern.

AGENT / ALGORITHM / POLICY / WALL_EXISTENCE / WALL_SIZE / REWARD_FUNCTION /




## Therefore, an example would look like this.

Mujoco_high_jump_simulator/models/Ant-/SAC/MlpPolicy/1/0.2/reward_function_1/ FILE_NAME



## For DNN or CNN :

AGENT / ALGORITHM / POLICY / CRITIC_SIZE / WALL_EXISTENCE / WALL_SIZE / REWARD_FUNCTION /
